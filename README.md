This is a bus booking system for ticket masters who can automate their work using this web app. It is recommended you import the sql database in your myPHP console in order to test the backend. The sql database contains dummy route data as well ticket prices. It also contains the information of whether a seat is booked or not. All of this data can be update using the web app. The app also contains an admin panel where you can see user data and update them as necessary.
